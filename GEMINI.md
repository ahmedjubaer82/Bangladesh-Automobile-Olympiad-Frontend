## Gemini Added Memories
- Today, I implemented student and admin authentication, including registration with a fixed admin password and Google Sign-In. I created pages for student profiles, past papers, and managed news and gallery content with demo data seeding. I also fixed several bugs related to routing, permissions, and data display. The user wants to continue tomorrow to further improve the user experience based on my suggestions.
- Today, I implemented several user experience improvements. I added loading spinners, toast notifications for user feedback, client-side image compression, and robust form validation using Formik and Yup. I have not yet implemented pagination and search functionality. The user wants to continue with these features tomorrow.
- Today, I fixed unused variable warnings in RegistrationPage.jsx. I also provided instructions on how to resume the chat session tomorrow. The user wants to continue with pagination and search functionality tomorrow.
- Today, I fixed the remaining unused variable warnings in RegistrationPage.jsx by removing the handleFileChange function and the setProfilePic setter. The user wants to continue with pagination and search functionality tomorrow.
- Today, I removed Google Sign-In and reconfigured the app for email/password authentication. I created a temporary component to delete all user data from Firestore and provided the user with the link to the Firebase console. I also unprotected all the pages for development and testing purposes and added a 'Dev' dropdown in the navbar with links to all the pages. The user wants to continue tomorrow.
- Today, I deleted the admin login and registration pages, merged admin and student login, added a secret key for admin registration, and allowed admins to enable/disable admin registration from the dashboard. I also made the 'Dev' button clickable and removed unnecessary files. I then implemented React Toastify for notifications and created a generic error page. I also restored the Exam and Results pages, fixed a white screen error by adding a missing import, and removed the disruptive error page redirect on login failure. I then changed the post-registration redirect to the homepage and made the 'Profile' button a 'Dashboard' button for admins. Finally, I rebuilt the authentication system to have student-only registration, a fixed admin account, and the ability for admins to add other admins from the dashboard. I also explained how Firestore collections are created automatically.
- Today, I moved Firebase configuration secrets from `src/firebase.js` to a `.env` file and added `.env` to `.gitignore`. I also updated `src/firebase.js` to use `import.meta.env` for accessing these variables. I also fixed the navbar logo image by importing it directly into `Navbar.jsx`. I am currently waiting for the user to confirm if the logo is visible, if seeded data is displayed correctly on News, Gallery, and Past Papers pages, and if there are any console errors.
